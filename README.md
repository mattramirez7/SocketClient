# SocketClient

**This repo is a basic Java TCP Socket Client application that will...**

- Connect to a server (command-line parameter) on a port (2nd command-line parameter)
- Take any input passed on the command line (any command-line parameter beyond 2), send it down the socket
- Capture any output from the socket, print it to the console
